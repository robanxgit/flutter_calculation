# Flutter Calculation App

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Flutter Calculation App** is a simple and interactive application built using Flutter. The project focuses on performing basic arithmetic operations efficiently while exploring Flutter’s UI components, state management, and platform compatibility. 

This project was developed as part of my learning experience in Flutter development, integrating knowledge from various online sources, AI tools, and collaboration with classmates.



## 🎯 **Purpose of the Project**
- To develop a user-friendly **calculator app** using **Flutter**.
- To learn and implement **state management** and **basic UI components**.
- To gain experience with **version control using Git and GitHub**.
- To explore **cross-platform compatibility** (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, macOS).
